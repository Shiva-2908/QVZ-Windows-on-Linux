# QVZ-Linux-Subsystem-for-Windows
QVZ Linux Subsystem for Windows (QVZ-LSW) is an experimental low-level project focused on running Windows binaries on Linux. It explores PE loading, relocations, ABI behavior, and subsystem design to understand Windows execution internals through native Linux-based implementation and research-driven systems development.
